# nft-generator

This is a collection of microservices that work together to generate an image, pin it to IPFS, and then mint it on the Ethereum blockchain as an NFT.

WIP. Based on a previous project I made using JS. The architecture is mostly the same, but this will be rewritten using Go and gRPC.
